# Custom Avatars
## Installation
The latest Custom Avatar plugin can be found in the [#pc-mods channel](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) in the BSMG discord or in [Mod Assistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant).
Once installed you should see a file called `CustomAvatar.dll` inside your `Plugins` folder. You should also see a folder called `CustomAvatars` in the main install folderâ€”this is where you will be placing the `*.avatar` files you want to use. You can download more avatars on [ModelSaber](https://modelsaber.com/Avatars/).

The plugin uses the keyboard to change the settings. Make sure you have the game in focus, i.e. click on the desktop game window.

## Creating Avatars
[Assistant's Avatar Guide](https://bs.assistant.moe/Avatars) is a good resource for learning how to make your own avatar.

The guide includes a [short video narrated by Megalon](https://bs.assistant.moe/Avatars#Videos), however it is intended to be an overview and you should watch it in addition to reading the guide, not lieu of.

Alternatively you can read [STsung's Avatar Guide](http://stefanekren.com/deckgen/vrmtoavatar.html) that describes the whole process in more detail. This guide also includes a [long video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeLw0cPqHe4) with commentary showing the whole process.
